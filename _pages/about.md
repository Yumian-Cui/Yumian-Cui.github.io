I'm a junior undergrad majoring in Economics(with Math emphasis) and Data Science at UW-Madison (also pursusing a Comp Sci certificate.) My coursework mainly involves data programming/modeling, statistical analysis, and econometrics etc, and learning languages such as Python, R, & SQL (Java intended as part of CS certificate.) As an aspiring data scientist and quantitative thinker, I'm in process of honing my skills by taking algorithm courses and doing projects outside of outside of school course to get hands-on experience. With respect to research, my interest lies on Natural Language Processing, Recommender System, and Human-Technology Interaction :)

In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, drawing, and listening to history podcasts.
