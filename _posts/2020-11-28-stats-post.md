Take some time to reorganize my understanding towards `p-value`  and keep a note here

-----

I feel this topic is rather important and worthy to dive into as 3 out of my 4 courses this semester have covered this concept. Yet having learned p-value and hypothesis testing on my AP course early since high school and my college introductory stats course, it always remains a bit foggy. Thus, in case I can't think straight at some point in the future, it would be good to review for consolidataion of understanding. (Below may contain reference to textbook)

For more than a dozen times, almost all stats teachers have emphasized that rejecting null doesn't mean it's true, it just means we fail to prove it's false. So what does it actually mean to reject the H0? Assume null is true, there has happend a low probability event. It seems too rare to happen but if it does happen, then it is worth the attention to suspect the validity of the null.
